# Welcome, I am Wanying Xie (谢琬滢).
I am a Master student at [Beijing Normal-Hong Kong Baptist University (BNBU)](https://www.uic.edu.cn/en/). Before that, I obtained my B.Eng. degree from [Zhejiang University of Finance and Economics (ZUFE)](https://english.zufe.edu.cn/), supervised by [Prof. Dr. Zhiguang Zhou](http://zhgzhou.hdvis.net/).

My research interest includes **Data Visualization** and **Human-Computer Interaction**. During my undergraduate studies, I conducted extensive visualization research under the supervision of my advisors. I published two research papers in the fields of economic behavior and climate.

I love exploring the unknown.
